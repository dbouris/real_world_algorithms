# Real World Algorithms

This repository contains exercises practising the Algorithmic thinking. Core objective of them is to actualy implement algorithms in Real World problems.
Those Assignments were completed during the Algorithms and Data Structures Course of the Department of Management Science and Technology in the Athens University of Economics and Business with professor [Panos Louridas](https://github.com/louridas). Theoretical knowledge on the topics and algorithms was provided by the book ["Real World Algorithms - A beginners guide" by Panos Louridas](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/real-world-algorithms).

## Assignment 1: Regular Crosswords
This assignment is about writing an algorithm to solve regular crosswords. A regular crossword differs from a simple crossword in the entry definition. In our case, the regular crossword, they will be given with the regular expressions, or regexes.
