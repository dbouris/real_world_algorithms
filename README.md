# Real World Algorithms

This repository contains exercises on Real World Algorithms. Core objective of them is to actual implement them in Real World problems. The solutions are written in Python without extensive use of external libraries which makes the coding process more complex.
Those Assignments were completed during the Algorithms and Data Structures Course of the Department of Management Science and Technology in the Athens University of Economics and Business with professor Panos Louridas //put a link here. Theoretical knowledge on the topics and algorithms was provided by the book "Real World Algorithms - A beginners guide" by Panos Louridas.
